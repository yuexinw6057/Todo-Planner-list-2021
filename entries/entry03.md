### Today, I began learning how to pull content from another website to the destinated website. Since my goal is trying to builld a planner that allows motivational quotes to be at the top of the screen each time the user refreshes, I am learning the beginning code to which it can be done. I have offically learned that I need to use HTML, CSS, js,[JSON], and API to build the planner. I am now looking at how to use [jquery](https://regroove.ca/archive/2013/03/21/how-to-pull-content-via-jquery-from-another-web-site-cross-domain-and-do-it-in-sharepoint-too/) to transfer content to my website. <br>

### In my current engineering designing process, I now understand what issues are people having. After further researching, I understand that people start to have more things to do as they are growing older. Using a planner as a solution will most definitely help people stay organized and remind them of what they need to do in whatever time frame they want to do things. However, I am still researching to understand the materials that I need to know to make my project. I have also learned from [here](http://www.steves-internet-guide.com/json-for-beginners/) that you can actually use JSONata to extract data from Json. I began practice by watching a [tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4uVwGw317QM) to get a better understanding of JS objects are. Below is some code snippets that I made in JSBin to help me understand what js object is. 

```
var person = {
  name: "Karen", 
  age: "12",
  height: "5'11"
}
console.log(person.name);
```
### The code above shows a variable named _person_ that is going to be storing all the data. when performs `console.log(person)`, every property of the person will be listed.   

### In order to transfer content from JSON to javascript, I would first need to understand how objects work. I used the code snippet to compare to JSON example that I created to see what the difference is since they have similar structures. <br>

```user.json{ "name" : "Kyle",
"favoriteNumber" : 5,
"isProgrammar" : True,
"hobbies" : ["swiming, gaming, singing, eating"].
}
```
### I also learned that JSON is only for file storing, it is not really a language that can be used to perfrom things. <br>
---
### My next steps are understand fully all the componets to js objects and using that knowledge to apply to JSON. Since I will be extracting content, I will also have to learn how to use API to transfer data from one to another to allow content to be written in my project.

### The skill I am developing is the skill of having a growth mindset and learning on my own. Previously, I was still a little confused on where I need to start in order to start developing my own project. I was at the edge of giving up since I did not know where to start, but now I know that I have to research for specifically what I want and what I want to know in order to fully understand something slowly but shortly. Learning on my own is not an easy task, even up until now I am still struggling to get the content 100%, but I am getting there.
