Today, I focused on designing layout that has been drawn out on paper. I am currently in the prototype process of designing my planner. I came up with some ideas that I can potentially put in on my planner websites and I am starting to layout the skeleton of the website with HTML. I needed to jot down these ideas first before they all disappear instantously. However, I also tested out how to get API from the quote website that I will be using [here](https://rapidapi.com/ipworld/api/quotes-inspirational-quotes-motivational-quotes).

Below is my first layout design: <br>

<img src="plannerDesign2" alt="img2" width="430" style="vertical-align:center"/> <br>

Using the drawing above, I created an html outline base upon the paper sketch with the following code:
```<img src="" alt="logo"/>
    </div>
    <div>
      <h1 style="text-align: center"> Majime Nomoki </h1>
    </div>
  </head>
  <body>
    <div class ="container">
    <div class="tasks">
      task 1
    </div>
     <div class="tasks">
      task 2
    </div>
     <div class="tasks">
      task 3
    </div>
    <div id = "first">
    </div>
    </div>
```
This following code above allows div tags to be created to create tasks to be inputted inside later with Javascripts and event listeners.  <br>

Using [W3Schools](https://www.w3schools.com/css/default.asp), I reviewed some of the coding that is needed to create the layout. At first, there is some issue with the code of the model blue div tag not being able to float to equal alignment, however, I have fixed that issue with a lot of trial and error. Although is this not truely related to learning JSON and API's I am obtaining more information about another language.

I am currently learning debugging and organizing. With an layout done on paper, I am starting to put things together with the debugging skills intacted on the way. Althought the process can be annoying sometimes, it is slowly coming together. My next steps are actually using API to my website and putting it together now.<br>
