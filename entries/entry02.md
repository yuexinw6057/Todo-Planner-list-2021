Today, I am confirming that I will be using [JSON APIs](https://jsonapi.org/) for web scraping 
and [wow.js](https://wowjs.uk/docs) to allow web interactiveness. I searched up on the web on
[what JSON APis can do](https://www.parsehub.com/blog/web-scraping-vs-api/) so that I can understand if it is the right tool for me to use. <br>

The current engineering designing process right now is researching the problems that many people face and trying
out the codes and seeing different examples to tweak it for better understanding since it is a new skill that I am learning on my own right now. 
My next step will be brainstorming the solutions that I can provide to the user to solve the forgetful nature of people. <br>

Since people forget, they would just usually leave it and lose motivations for whatever they wanted to do. Motivating qoutes will allow users 
to feel more empowered while they remember what they have to do.

I've grown in the skill of learning how to read to understand better especially when it comes to codes that I have never seen before. While 
searching up JSON APIs and Wow.js, I did not understand how it functions until I searched up the [documentations](https://jsonapi.org/examples/)
for APIs and [WOW.js](https://www.delac.io/wow/docs.html).
